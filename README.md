Here's a full **GitHub `README.md` file** you can use for your **Code Review Assistant (Lite)** project. This covers setup steps, functionality, and future improvements.

# 🧠 Code Review Assistant (Lite)

A lightweight AI-powered code review assistant built using a small LLM (`Salesforce/codet5-small`) and static code analysis tools like `pylint`. Designed to help developers get instant, local feedback on their code without relying on cloud APIs.

> Ideal for teams aiming to enhance code quality, maintainability, and security — all with low resource usage (<1GB model).

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Paste code or upload Python files for analysis
- 🤖 Get improvement suggestions via a small transformer-based LLM
- 🧪 Get static warnings and code smells using `pylint`
- 📊 Integrated with Streamlit for a simple UI
- 🔐 Runs fully offline — no data leaves your machine

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/code-review-assistant.git
cd code-review-assistant
````

2. **Set up virtual environment (optional)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## 🧪 Usage

* Paste Python code into the input box OR load a file (feature coming soon)
* Click `Run Review`
* See results:

  * 🤖 LLM Suggestions: High-level improvements (naming, duplication, readability)
  * 🧪 Static Analysis: `pylint` warnings and best practices

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* `review_engine.py` loads `codet5-small` (220MB) from Hugging Face
* The code snippet is sent as a natural language prompt to the LLM
* Simultaneously, `pylint` is executed to provide static feedback
* Results are displayed in real-time in the Streamlit app

## ⚙️ Models & Tools Used

| Component      | Details                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| LLM Model      | `Salesforce/codet5-small` (under 300MB) |
| Tokenizer      | Hugging Face Transformers               |
| Static Checker | `pylint` for Python                     |
| UI             | Streamlit                               |

## 📌 Example Output

```python
Input Code:
def process(data):
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data[i] != None:
            print(data[i])

LLM Suggestion:
Use `is not None` instead of `!= None`. Consider iterating with `for item in data` to improve readability.

Pylint Output:
W:1,0: Missing function docstring (missing-function-docstring)
C:2,4: Consider using enumerate instead of range(len()) (consider-using-enumerate)
```

* [ ] Inline diff and annotation view
* [ ] File upload support for `.py`, `.java`
* [ ] GitHub PR bot integration
* [ ] CrewAI integration for modular agent-based execution
